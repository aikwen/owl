"""Type definitions for data invocation configurations.

This module defines the declarative types used by owl data invocation objects.

A data invocation does not load resources or construct datasets directly.
Instead, it records enough information for the invocation resolver to build the
data pipeline in three distinct stages:

    dataset root
    -> EntrySource
    -> OwlDataset
    -> DataLoader

Keeping these stages separate preserves the responsibilities of the existing
data layer:

- ``EntrySource`` describes stable source-level sample facts.
- ``OwlDataset`` loads resources and applies transforms and sample hooks.
- ``DataLoader`` controls batching and iteration behavior.

The aliases in this module describe configuration values only. They do not
perform path normalization, file-system validation, entry-source construction,
or dataloader argument validation.

PathLike: TypeAlias = str | Path
"""Path representation accepted by data invocation declarations.

String paths are preserved while the invocation configuration is being
declared. The data resolver converts each value to ``Path`` immediately before
constructing the configured entry source.

The invocation layer intentionally does not normalize paths eagerly because
configuration construction should not depend on the current working directory
or access the file system.
"""


EntrySourceConstructor: TypeAlias = Callable[[Path], EntrySource]
"""Callable that constructs an entry source from a dataset root.

The constructor receives one normalized ``Path`` and returns an object
satisfying the ``EntrySource`` structural protocol:

    entry_source = constructor(root)

An entry-source class commonly satisfies this alias:

    class CustomEntrySource:
        def __init__(self, root: Path) -> None:
            ...

        def __len__(self) -> int:
            ...

        def __getitem__(self, index: int) -> SampleEntry:
            ...

The class object itself acts as the constructor:

    constructor = CustomEntrySource
    entry_source = constructor(
        Path("datasets/custom"),
    )

A compatible function or callable object may also be used:

    def create_entry_source(root: Path) -> EntrySource:
        return CustomEntrySource(root)

The alias describes the required call signature rather than a concrete class
or inheritance relationship. Entry-source implementations therefore do not
need to inherit from ``EntrySource`` explicitly.
"""


DataDeclaration: TypeAlias = (
    PathLike
    | tuple[PathLike, EntrySourceConstructor]
)
"""Declaration of one logical dataset source.

A declaration supports two forms.

The compact form contains only a dataset root:

    "datasets/casia_v1"

The owning data configuration supplies the default entry-source constructor for
this form.

The override form contains a dataset root and a local entry-source constructor:

    (
        "datasets/custom",
        CustomEntrySource,
    )

The local constructor takes precedence over the default constructor configured
at the data-object level.

During resolution, the selected constructor receives the normalized dataset
root:

    entry_source = constructor(
        Path(root),
    )

Entry-source constructors are expected to accept one normalized dataset root as
their only resolver-injected argument in v0.0.2.
"""


LoaderOptions: TypeAlias = Mapping[str, Any]
"""Keyword arguments forwarded to `torch.utils.data.DataLoader`.

The invocation layer stores dataloader options as a generic mapping instead of
duplicating the complete PyTorch `DataLoader` constructor in an owl-specific
configuration class.

Configuration objects copy this mapping during initialization so later
top-level mutations to the caller-owned mapping do not change the stored
configuration. Data resolvers create their own `dict` before forwarding the
options to `DataLoader`.

These options are intended for DataLoader-level behavior such as batching,
worker configuration, memory pinning, collation, and related iteration
settings.

Training samplers are declared separately through `TrainData.sampler`.
Unlike ordinary DataLoader options, a sampler may require access to the final
resolved training dataset before it can be constructed. The training data
resolver therefore materializes the sampler after resolving the dataset and
injects the resulting sampler instance into the DataLoader options before
constructing the `DataLoader`.

Compatibility between the remaining forwarded DataLoader options remains the
responsibility of PyTorch's `DataLoader` implementation.
"""



SamplerConstructor: TypeAlias = Callable[..., Sampler]
"""Callable that constructs a sampler for a resolved training dataset.

The training data resolver supplies the resolved dataset as the first
argument. Additional sampler-specific options may be forwarded as keyword
arguments:

    sampler = constructor(
        dataset,
        **options,
    )

The resolved dataset may be a single dataset or a ``ConcatDataset`` depending
on the training data declaration.
"""


SamplerDeclaration: TypeAlias = (
    SamplerConstructor
    | tuple[SamplerConstructor, Mapping[str, Any]]
)
"""Declaration describing how to construct a training sampler.

The alias describes the construction contract rather than requiring a
sampler class specifically. Compatible functions and callable factory objects
may also satisfy this alias.

A sampler constructor may be supplied directly:

    sampler=CustomSampler

The resolver constructs it with the resolved dataset:

    CustomSampler(dataset)

Sampler-specific keyword arguments may also be supplied:

    sampler=(
        CustomSampler,
        {
            "seed": 42,
        },
