"""Inference data invocation configuration and resolver.

This module defines the declarative configuration used to construct inference
data pipelines and the resolver that materializes those declarations.

Inference sources remain independent because each source represents one named
evaluation or visualization dataset:

    named data declarations
    -> one OwlDataset per name
    -> one DataLoader per name
    -> dict[str, DataLoader]

Dataset names are preserved throughout resolution and can be injected directly
into ``InferSession``.

    """Configuration describing named inference data pipelines.

    Each entry in ``sources`` represents one logical inference dataset:

        {
            "casia_v1": "datasets/casia_v1",
            "columbia": "datasets/columbia",

    Compact declarations use the inherited ``entry`` field as their default
    entry-source constructor. Declarations containing a local entry-source
    constructor use that constructor instead.

    Unlike training datasets, inference datasets are never combined. Resolution
    creates one independent dataloader for every declared name.

            Mapping from inference dataset names to data declarations.

            The supplied mapping is copied during initialization so later
            mutations to the caller-owned mapping do not affect the stored
            configuration. Dictionary insertion order is preserved.
